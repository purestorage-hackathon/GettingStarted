# Pure//Accelerate 2017 hackathon 0.5

Welcome to the Pure Storage's first hackathon! We are excited to put on this event for our customers and partners at Pure//Acclerate 2017. Our goal with this event is to get people excited, aware and thinking about how to leverage our investments in our REST API, PowerShell, Python, VMware and Microsoft integrations. 

## Goals
* Work with us to jumpstart your efforts around scripting and automation
* Work with us to see how our APIs and integrations can be used in your DevOps efforts
* FEEDBACK! We want to hear feedback from you on what we have, what we don't, what you need in terms of DevOps, CI/CD and general automation
* Hang with us and chat
